# Test Data

The `data/test` folder contains test data which consists of audio transcriptions for the evaluation stage of the competition. There is only one file in the test data:

- Crowd Transcriptions (`responses.csv`). This file contains triples (id of audio, transcription, id of annotator).

Your model should work with crowd transcriptions to aggregate them into a single transcription of each audio. Please see our starter kit on the [main GitHub page](https://github.com/Toloka/VLDB2021_Crowd_Science_Challenge).
