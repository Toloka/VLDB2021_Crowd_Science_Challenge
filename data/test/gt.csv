3776,because i will never have it again
945,because i'd planned to come and kill you myself
1878,because she hadn't really thought about the girl's boobs until now

3976,failure was always a part of any career but this was difficult to take
3481,father will be keeping an eye on him
1340,fear swelled in her chest
2607,finally she looks into his eyes unexpectedly shocked to see the eyes of a stranger
3126,finally when i was about to cry myself she looked up at me
2718,finally after a nearly audible internal struggle the president nodded
351,first of all there aren't that many things with me
777,for an answer i suddenly had an image of a rooftop
4326,for now though i think it would be better for you to stay out here
3752,for some reason she couldn't explain the thought made her furious
1459,for some reason the mutters comforted me
87,for the family i doubted i'd ever see again
3403,for the first time in a hundred and twenty years giving up felt like a viable option
872,for the greater good perhaps but he'd be gone nonetheless
121,for the time draws near
2934,forcing my face to relax i nodded
685,foreign images people and places twirled and tumbled in her mind until her head swam from them
1700,forget cupcakes i think to myself i need a beer and a burger to think this one through
1858,fortunately they were kept back by barriers
4464,fortunately those were the subjects of their questions
4491,fourth all other radio traffic appears normal
838,from behind someone bumped into me and i stumbled forward
1851,from deep in the lake a large bubble rose to the surface followed by a couple more
1612,from everywhere came the somnolent buzz of bees
1254,get her into the wind
2799,getting printer to countermand will be politically fractious
1826,glancing from her to the building i shook my head
4091,go do what must be done
362,gold scroll accents separated each floor
3651,gone was his undying love for me
1606,good thing he already had his hands on the wheel
570,good i was still reaching them
4086,good let her explain to my parents
1500,goose bumps prickled along her skin
4020,guilt washed over me and the pain of realization
856,had he heard what we were saying
843,hanging in between from the same hook were a plain white shirt and a gunbelt
2345,have i found you yet
3849,having said those words the black knight appalled me by removing his armor and then his clothes
3847,he almost let it out but he didn't
3969,he and padre exchanged glances
101,he apparently seemed amused at the thought
2876,he appeared to the crowd who roared in a frenzy
452,he assured me that he'd never work with her again
3182,he barked out a surprised laugh
3027,he bellowed wheeling his horse around and waving his spontoon
1323,he bought ten of them
2666,he called out as he headed for the stairs
3576,he can keep his bloody foal
1177,he caught it in his hand like he always does
3097,he considered splurging on a sausage or a couple pretzels but his principles won out
1646,he contemplated his next move
231,he could almost laugh at the order
2361,he could finally see a little more clearly
2064,he could have left for all she knew
3056,he could tell his imperturbable attitude was getting to her
1332,he couldn't have looked gayer if he'd tried
3111,he couldn't hold her gaze and she stared at his sympathetic face
3241,he couldn't miss the alarm in her voice
59,he cranked on the shower and plunged them under the spray
4156,he crooked his finger under her chin
3306,he deals with your question in this book
3192,he delivered blow after blow spacing them out spreading them over my ass and thighs
3299,he did all his work at a desk with phone books and computer databases
3703,he did slip up and do something nice every now and then
1513,he did the math in his head
94,he didn't act like a normal dog who barked and wagged his tail and slurped water
3148,he didn't know where he was going but he knew he needed to get away from there
2900,he didn't look convinced
850,he didn't look up
2719,he didn't move either to acknowledge my touch or shake it off
2908,he didn't need to turn on the lights to see the carnage
3620,he didn't seem to notice
319,he didn't show up at the truck
2731,he didn't try to stop me but instead leaned back against the tile wall and closed his eyes
3822,he didn't want a woman to turn on him or worse have her family come for his
1649,he didn't want to know the truth of what he already suspected
168,he doesn't sound happy and i scramble off my bed rushing to see what he wants
730,he ducked through the entrance and right away i knew something was wrong
4000,he eyed me like a fresh baked cookie
1644,he falls to a pile of ash that blows onto my shoes
3186,he felt a warm sensation coming over him soothing his body paralysing it
3071,he floats up into the sky revealing an expanse of large feathered wings wide as a house
4383,he followed me inside the building anyway
1883,he followed with an extra bout of anger
1791,he forced himself to stop thinking about the girl before him on the floor
339,he gasped and reached a hand out to me
3949,he gave her a surprised look
1039,he gave me a sexy look
3704,he glanced covertly at the body tonic trainers
982,he glanced over at her
762,he glances up at me still impassive
2023,he glared at her for interrupting his thoughts
2354,he growled and snapped at me
4488,he grunted dropping her hand
3933,he gulped down the rest
336,he had a feeling she was serious and he didn't want her to hurt herself
2438,he had a way with charming people to think he was great
3755,he had already screwed up enough for one night
1656,he had been a protector on this journey and they had become close perhaps too close at times
2218,he had been promoted only because he was a man and he worked long hours
374,he had come searching for the lake and had got his face poisoned by some pretty shrub
2515,he had fixed it so it wouldn't take a message
4448,he had his chance and he fucked that up
1223,he had made the same mistake with the bats on his first visit
517,he had obviously been dead for quite some time
2265,he had other things on his mind like getting married
1537,he had seen magic before but this power was something else entirely
104,he had to remain focused
1229,he hadn't even realized he'd been letting his power leak out
3698,he hadn't realized i was sinking
3153,he halted at the window and pulled aside the curtain
3525,he has always been a restless spirit
1463,he has shown me how to use mine your angel jol remember
312,he headed for the door not glancing behind him to see if she was following
2036,he headed out to get his wife and daughter
3013,he held his arms out
642,he hesitated then nodded and moved off
434,he hooked his thumbs into his belt and glanced around
3716,he hurt you bad and you need to get help
3325,he ignored it just glad the lesson was over intending to cancel his speech tomorrow
4189,he inhaled deeply closing his eyes as if he could taste me
2083,he introduced the general and the kids applauded
4262,he is also a good friend
2775,he just continued to stare at her with an undisguised loathing
4078,he kept stopping to point out the various colleges and research buildings
1516,he kissed me on the lips lingering
2764,he knows about your interesting past
1066,he laughed at my expression as i enjoyed the expresso
2578,he laughed startling her with the rumbling sound that welled from his chest
2616,he laughs but it's an irritable laugh
2210,he leaned back against the railing and looked at me
3530,he leaned into the wall but sagged eyes shut tight
2600,he leant over the sofa and looked at the game sky had been playing on the ipad
3431,he let her go with more reluctance than he would have liked
1277,he locked the door and then followed me down the hall to my bedroom
4384,he looked around at his family
144,he looked at me with a face that was still wet but now impatient too
166,he looked at the coin he had brought back with him this time
72,he looked behind him worked the levers and the purposely shaky camera backed away
2553,he looked down at his screen
2334,he lowered his head until his parted lips brushed her shoulder
3788,he made a civil excuse
2009,he made a decision and acted on it
1600,he moaned and pulled her lips back to his
3135,he moved his fingers in and out easy with how wet she was
1692,he must take after his father
1857,he never had to prove himself to anyone or put anyone in their place
4421,he nodded and twisted his hat in his hands
3216,he nodded and a dark look passed over his features
332,he nosed around the apartment disappeared for a moment in the bedroom where he continued to take photos
2302,he numbly removes his coat then stands there with it in his hands
2016,he packed the pistol and some ammunition in his belt wallet
2512,he paused letting the loaded question hang in the air for a moment inept to words
3160,he paused once more perfectly expressionless
3407,he picked her up and twirled her on top of him
903,he picks up a pillow and tosses it at the window
2868,he placed his hand over it figuring it for a better weapon than bare hands
4469,he played the incident back through his mind and made sure he had it all straight
2362,he pondered my question looking down at his plate
893,he popped the screen off and hopped in
376,he poured water from the bedroom ewer into the basin and laved his face with water preparatory to shaving
92,he pulled her down shielding her with his body
885,he pulled the boy to his chest and held him there
132,he pulls his gaze from the road and glances at me
3894,he put a hand on his sword hilt but decided against drawing it
4361,he put his finger to her lips
1377,he put his hand to the back of his neck above his left shoulder
626,he puts his jacket on and heads toward the front door to leave
4367,he raced over to his desk and turned down the music but left it on as a distraction
2172,he reached behind her and unfastened her bra
2832,he reached them breathless and sweating
2981,he reaches out and places his hand over mine on the desk
4276,he really needed his levelheaded sanity
3053,he refers to me as his wife but has no intention of ever being married
1811,he replaced the weapon and got out some medical supplies
1174,he rested his shoulder against a towering hardwood his uninjured side as close as he would come to relaxing
2262,he roared in a great voice
3946,he said casually as if she hadn't spoken
1921,he said in a despairing tone
254,he said it was so we could clear the air
1861,he said barely fifteen minutes later
3168,he said with the unmistakable air of someone pushing themselves to interact his voice just a little too loud
1339,he saved them both by not answering because the answer didn't matter
4392,he scooches next to me
2206,he seemed overly tense with no apparent reason
3029,he senses the tension coming from the crew and then says something amazing
4497,he shifted me so that he stayed inside of me securely
4368,he shifted seconds before they passed through where he'd been
320,he shook his head and laughed
1366,he shoved something soft into my hands
449,he slowly steps into the kitchen not taking his eyes off me
3092,he smiled and anyway you wouldn't set them on me would you
4145,he snatched her into his arms and swung her in a circle
1030,he softly kissed her cheek and her blood pressure spiked
1009,he spoke the last softly as if to himself
239,he spoke with absolute confidence believing it the truth
3977,he spun around to see her facing him
1206,he stands and turns away from me
2431,he stared at her for a few cool seconds and then stepped back and held the door open
1739,he stared at it a second wishing he was the type of man to walk away
3281,he stared at the map and its indicators realizing they have the high ground on rugged terrain
3350,he started to jog towards his wagon when he stopped
2944,he started to laugh at me and shook his head
2686,he started to pull back
3669,he startled her by leaping from his chair
1688,he stepped away from me again a sad smile on his face
3304,he stiffens but does not pull away
133,he still had to be opening for the drift
2290,he stood up straight and hit his head
2270,he stumbled when he landed but quickly got up and brushed the dirt from his arms
814,he sucked in a deep breath then let it out
3346,he takes a step towards me
1273,he thought it might be best to take his students essays home with him rather than marking them here
4405,he threw up his hands in frustration
4141,he tipped my chin up and i trembled his touch rekindling the desire inside me
759,he told me to put you through immediately if you called
3939,he took her in his arms and kissed her
1676,he took her phone from her hand and stuck it in his pocket
1809,he trailed his lips down to the corner of her mouth
2143,he turned in his seat and studied her for a long breathless moment
463,he turns around and faces me slowly eyeing me up and down
2396,he turns the paper around so i can see
2703,he twisted a piece of her hair around his index finger
3854,he walked with a limp his gangly left leg swinging out to allow for his rigid knee
2451,he wanted to believe her
4334,he wanted to expose me right in front of my friends
3859,he wanted to see her
4372,he wanted to watch her from a distance but he made himself pull back
4246,he wants to be out of here in short order
2819,he wants you to leave me and go with him
3782,he was a man that needed evidence before he acted
1908,he was about to ask her if she could do that later when he heard a voice he recognized
2080,he was already taking off his coat
3391,he was checking statistics for our new home
3938,he was cruel and ruthless and got the job done
2159,he was going to climb it and didn't want them to panic when he disappeared out of view
3826,he was nice enough just wanted to know more about the castle
1045,he was pinning her down so tightly that she couldn't move forward
3014,he was pleased too but he tried to take the matter seriously
2453,he was sharing so i might as well take advantage
931,he was telling her all about it when the doorbell rang
1400,he was thinking not as a police officer but as a man who had lost a loved one
1695,he wasn't going to play nurse anymore
3367,he went to the window and looked out at the city
2370,he will have others with him
1902,he would have harmed her or even tried to kidnap her
1891,he'd been trained in the mechanics but not in how to be mentally prepared for something so horrific
237,he'd expected her to return to her home crossing into the portal without a look back
1433,he'd kept it not able to let it go
1388,he'd laughed when her gaze couldn't help but slide down his body to him erect and wanting her
280,he'd left enough of an electronic trail
1127,he'd loved her almost from the beginning just as she'd loved him
4335,he'd protected her from her own lack of faith in herself
804,he's learned a couple of things that have him all worried
3399,he's much older and much more powerful
9,hell you saw them get installed
2978,her absolute assumption he was the father was unnerving to say the least
2989,her answer makes me feel the tiniest bit less selfish
61,her arousal wasn't entirely due to the lust that pulsed through the air
1480,her back if seen from afar looked totally exposed
180,her bare chest rakes over my skin and i groan both in and out of my fantasy
2702,her breath caught at the sensation of his hot mouth on her cool skin
3338,her eyes plead with me
3617,her eyes were kind and i wanted to believe her
2730,her eyes were wide her mouth open for a breath that would not come
836,her eyes as blue as the sky regarded him intently
4187,her face softened for a moment
2575,her face was white marble
4449,her gaze drifted toward the porch door
2463,her gaze fell down his body
2592,her hand on his knee
963,her heart burst as he knelt at her feet and she stepped into the panties
3899,her heart pounded as he leaned down his breath sweet and warm on her face
1699,her knees were up her skin dripping with sweat her eyes closed in a pale face
4163,her little knuckles were red from clenching her fists
3423,her next task was to search for hotels in the area
2052,her smile was more sad than sardonic
4357,her tears wet my face as i kissed her hungrily my tongue pushing between her lips
2633,her tilted face is committed to assisting her hands in finish buttoning her shirt
3568,her vocal cords tensed with the weight of the words
2174,her voice caught on the word
3262,her warts glowed bright green
2959,here again technology is tolerated even preferred
3468,hey you two whats going on
1533,his arms tightened around her
3835,his attention was drawn to the large window set high into the wall in front of him
654,his beard is thick and shot through with gray
643,his belongings were taken down by two hotel staffers under the direction and watchful eye of his brothers
1846,his best friend's wife answered on the third ring
3104,his blade touched the inside of my wrists tracing a vein
3759,his bleary eyes were mutinous stubbornly resistant
3330,his blood spattered like rain over her face and hands the desk and the laptop's keyboard
2677,his blood surged and flowed beckoned to her
4280,his cheek was against mine his hand wrapped around my head and forehead as he tried to shelter me
3864,his cold blue eyes pierced the air between them
3870,his dark angry glare zeroed in on me as a sick smile spread his face
930,his even temperament didn't challenge him to get riled up over petty issues
1515,his eyebrows were pulled slightly together forming long horizontal lines on his forehead
701,his eyes burned closed but he fought the blackness knowing if he had a concussion he should stay awake
2255,his eyes watered but nothing changed
3514,his eyes were dark and greedy as he raked a delighted glance over her body
2704,his eyes were on the awning that was in front of him
1770,his eyes were wet his brow furrowed in wild concern
509,his face had gone from white to red when he pulled the door open and looked back at me
27,his face was sharpened almost contorted by desperation
4441,his fake wife she reminded herself as she climbed up the stairs to the sanctuary of her room
2495,his fingers linger over my shoulders before repeating the process all over again
1498,his fingers locked around the wolf's snout
2965,his fingertips glided over her skin stopping every few inches to rub and squeeze
2482,his fist went flying hitting me square in the stomach
4402,his gaze met hers and now his irises were bright with amber sparks skewering her where she stood
1788,his glasses slipped a few inches down his nose
2046,his gray eyes were grave as they met hers
2402,his hair is light brown and cut relatively short
3392,his hand reached out and grabbed my wrist
2829,his head was resting in his hands and i wasn't even sure if he noticed i had arrived
1076,his lip curls as he runs the credit card through his machine
2566,his lips curl as his dimples depress themselves an inch on either side
658,his lips were pursed tightly together
3174,his lips were swollen pink and wet
1170,his majesty is expecting you
2035,his metal armor glinted in the red glow and his metal visor hid his golden eyes
1888,his nerves wouldn't take it
4258,his own blade met mine the druid tumbling from his arms
646,his own death would be a lost bubble burst in such a conflagration
1573,his sarcasm didn't amuse me
4232,his strides were long and purposeful indicating that he knew exactly where he was going
2523,his swing mate asks elbowing him in the gut
3152,his taste his warmth and his strength consumed her fear
2822,his teeth grazed her clitoris and that was all it took
1203,his teeth nipped the inside of her thighs
3523,his tone was no longer teasing or sexy
325,his touch was intoxicating as his hands splayed her legs farther and farther apart
2963,his voice dropped lower as he sobered
1258,his voice was a whisper
607,his voice wasn't strident any longer
1504,his whole body vibrated with the intensity of his need
2434,his words heated my skin as his mouth latched onto my nipple
675,honestly i thought we should all go
3017,how could he say this was his fault when so far he had been nothing but nice
1562,how could it be ringing
2088,how could she have ever been so stupid as to trust a daimon
1859,how could so many colors a range of so many emotions come into play at once and make sense
3732,how could you explain staring into the dark heart of a black hole
3440,how did these things work
2013,how far away was he
3297,how had i not noticed that before
767,how much further can they go
1357,how soon till his fire burns hot enough to crack stone and melt iron
2022,however i wish i had mastered it now
3496,however it lacked the accusation that a human would have put into the words
4216,however right now she needed her father more than him
3737,humor dances in his eyes
4487,hurried through the snow into the road as other engines roared to life
574,hurstgrove slid into the driver's seat buckled up and rolled down the window
2945,i accidently hit a button
4284,i also rejected the charm since it somehow elevated luck over ability which she would never do
3136,i am no street child
4154,i arrive at the island after what feels like an hour but is more likely ten minutes
946,i ask my eyes wide with feigned ignorance
1923,i ask touching his forearm
2773,i asked her lifting my own eyebrows in faux innocence
1145,i asked not really believing the dramatic change of treatment from the day before
3642,i bet it was hilarious
1547,i bolted upright in the bed and turned toward bo
2979,i breathed out through my teeth
1690,i bring the crop down against her clit
3770,i can do this for you
2821,i can not bear it
2250,i can not even think of you being wrong at the first place
3879,i can't explain to you how deep my emotions run
717,i can't stop looking at her
2283,i cant believe he's actually shirtless
3678,i certainly didn't kiss her
122,i clutched mom's arm as my mind lurched and sputtered
4256,i could break it but not without a lot of trouble
538,i could feel her anger now at me
831,i could have lied but instead i shrugged
83,i could not forgive him for having done this
3016,i could string some flowers through it
80,i could tell he was a killer by the look in his eye
2222,i couldn't challenge her because the challenge had to come from the ground up
1488,i couldn't cool my face for the rest of lunch
278,i couldn't look at him
2279,i couldn't speak for the others but i was simply wrung out physically and emotionally
2349,i crash my lips to his and engage in a long riotously angry kiss
178,i did it so that you could be happy
309,i didn't care that we didn't have a lot of money
3475,i didn't know which way was north and which way was south
4261,i didn't like the way his body seemed to just collapse against her
1849,i didn't realize i'd said it out loud until bill answered
96,i didn't say you could talk yet
4178,i didn't want her to take it so easily and walk away
2780,i didn't want to die like this
3038,i didn't want to keep thinking and analyzing the situation anymore
3659,i do as the most high commands
1541,i do not believe that he is military
1711,i don't have to defeat her
2889,i don't know if she buys my relaxed pose
2913,i don't know what to do
1565,i don't think he begins
1569,i don't think we have enough time for a real foray into the woods today
3802,i don't want to see any more zigzagging goobies
4396,i doubted that there was a thing about me that he didn't consider his
4084,i feel like a tooheys i feel like a tooheys i feel like a tooheys or two
3323,i felt an uncontrollable shiver run down my spine and i held my breath
3925,i felt better than i had in years
569,i felt like she was offending my tribe
1423,i felt the warm and familiar response of the green
3774,i finally understand what they are doing
3667,i finish in a whisper
3861,i finished off the last of my beer gulping down half the bottle in one shot
1265,i flick a switch and a light hum sounds in the room
4482,i flopped down onto the bed and stared up at the ceiling
1744,i folded both notes separately and tucked them side by side under the base of my telephone
2369,i folded my fingers together trying to keep calm
3025,i force myself off the couch and into the bathroom
1224,i found it on my bed this morning the note said to protect it
519,i found myself wishing that i had a shirt to pull off my body and hand over to her
1636,i gently brushed the ebony hair from her forehead capturing the moment like a diamond in my heart
1732,i give them all the scoop on the soaps
1751,i glanced at our prisoners
4037,i glanced down at the check with no idea what to expect
4128,i glued patterns out of silver glitter on the wings and sewed sequins along the hem of the dress
3547,i grab the bottle of shower gel
4215,i grabbed the tupperware container filled with the cookies id baked and rushed to the back door
3534,i grabbed them and then headed down the hall
4345,i groaned aloud this time
2456,i guess i missed that class
622,i guess you can bring the boyfriend along if you want
1040,i had been paid three hundred a month in the army
2576,i had to tell him
2538,i had to watch two police officers hold her down and she still escaped them to get to chase
3987,i hadn't had a place of my own for two years now
3270,i half smiled and looked down at my phone
588,i hand her a painting mask with filters sticking out on both sides
2444,i have no idea what the time is maybe i'll wake him
2072,i have no trouble imagining that it belongs to some polished douchenozzle of a lawyer
4462,i have not changed my mind
2090,i have too many anyway
865,i haven't even been able to work because i'm thinking of you missing you
1927,i heard a soft squish as he plunged his fist into the incision
2749,i hope she is seeing the same stars
3048,i hope you agree about it
535,i hopped up and stomped on her hand
3687,i inquired pulling out my cell
57,i jerked staring into his gorgeous face in surprise
2001,i just had to figure out how to get there
1193,i just want to see you
3124,i just wanted to ride this wave because i hadn't felt this good in months
4185,i just wanted you to know
4019,i kissed the top of her head again
1523,i knew from how cold i was that i was butt naked
439,i knew it was safer to back away and continue my walk home
3971,i knew what he would do
3586,i knew what i had to do
4414,i know most everyone in town
3764,i laid my head down on my arms and wondered what the heck i was going to do now
2125,i laugh when he chuckles and growls rolling me beneath him
495,i lean my head back again and look at my now wrinkled fingers
3994,i leaned over and dropped the baby mattress inside the finished crib
4164,i licked my lips and managed a smile
1086,i lifted my head half an inch and kissed him
1629,i looked down at the trip wire thinking about the danger
4244,i looked over my shoulder smiling
2992,i looked to my mom
2545,i made a note to pay out the families of both men
1535,i made it all up
1905,i mean he tried to kill us right
4238,i mean it could have been addressing anyone
1958,i mean if i could see it in the air sure
2496,i mean you can walk us both
2421,i mechanically reached over and bishop grabbed my hand and guided it into the bag
2877,i met her eyes and felt a swelling in my chest
3339,i must be more tactful
396,i must say he had to wonder
2426,i narrowed my eyes suddenly recalling his reference to how different his life was six years later
1300,i need to mark you first to make sure i get these bars in perfect
1466,i never would have thought i'd like sex a bit on the rough side
710,i nodded because looking into his dark eyes there wasn't any other answer
2882,i outlined the area with one finger and tried to rub the itch away
2873,i owed it and it would see me through so i could pay my debt
657,i pluck a daisy off a stem
1106,i pretended to be shocked
754,i promise everything will be fine
2027,i promise to make you smile at least once a day
4051,i pull my hand away from his
4151,i pull out the drain plug and climb out
1521,i pulled back and looked up at his face
595,i put my chin on his chest and moved my face so i could look at him
2753,i raise my hands between us and let my head fall into them
76,i reached for her hand
2494,i regained my composure whispering
3955,i regret to tell you that you must be leaving soon
980,i remind myself that it too is business
4059,i roll my eyes instead of commenting taking another bite as he laughs
3103,i rose slowly my heart hammering and my whole body trembling
761,i said you wouldn't like the answer
2664,i say but my words are lost as lia screams sounding weak and terrified
1781,i scanned the wooden bleachers hoping to find seats near the top but it was full
135,i scoffed unable to believe the tiny tattoo marking my neck was worthy of jealousy
4430,i scream silently with joy
1244,i screamed in his face leaning towards him
3493,i shake my head timing it just right
502,i shivered because i couldn't help it
2661,i shouted and moved forward
2509,i shut my eyes tightly and tried to calm my breathing
4119,i smiled and was asleep before i hit the lounge
899,i snorted laughing out loud
328,i sock him in the arm trying to keep things light
2928,i sold everyone that crap story you made up
2372,i spread my thighs for him stepping out of the tangle of my shorts and panties as i do
1620,i squeeze his hands and he squeezes them back
3199,i stare at it in disbelief
4481,i stared back at him
2514,i started unbuttoning his shirt
4308,i stood on my crutches for a moment listening to the dial tone
3940,i stopped dead in my tracks forcing him to as well
2289,i suddenly noticed it in his eyes too
3750,i suppose it's no surprise
4062,i suspect that it won't
635,i swallowed back the tears and fled into the hallway
106,i swallowed roughly and sighed
731,i swear i didn't mean to do that
252,i take a few steps back but he follows
171,i take that as a hint he is now bored of me or wants to be alone
1945,i tense up but nod
3758,i think she might be one of them
3912,i think she's screwing with my brain
4132,i think the languages are just him showing off and keeping us from realizing what is really there
2272,i thought i put this away
3437,i thought of the baby that i carried inside me
2625,i thought to myself just suck it up
3948,i thought you had abandoned that idea
1432,i threw my head back and laughed
2952,i told her my aunt was getting married
2635,i told her to lie low this time every night
1478,i told many of my fellow students that i was going
3960,i told you it was hormones
3714,i touch her knee her bottom her hair
3347,i tried not to flinch but i couldn't stop the reaction
3965,i tried to kick him off to shift his weight but it was no use
4218,i tried to let go of those memories especially now when i needed something hopeful to cling to
1172,i try to keep my eyes down
2602,i turn around and start walking back to my house
2074,i turned to him and smiled
4386,i waited again but she wouldn't say anything else
1983,i waited dekas for revenge thought it would elude my grasp
2014,i want nothing more than to curl up with him for an entire eternity
3221,i want the shirt gone
3131,i want to obey the laws
1139,i want you to know that
3157,i want you to love me
561,i wanted him to know that i wasn't helpless
853,i wanted it to stop
1742,i wanted to feel the weight of him on top of me sweating digging and grinding
3672,i wanted to tell him that he was a coward if he went through with the arranged wedding
1527,i wanted you to go with me
2400,i was glad i had jeans on to protect my legs
3463,i was going to miss him
2048,i was gonna use that to pay down my loans
1014,i was jealous of them
960,i was just a part of your past that you didn't have closure on
3446,i was just about to
1167,i was just so worried and i don't like you being with her
2638,i was measuring a bit larger than normal but nothing out of the ordinary
384,i was near a window and managed to jump and avoid the brunt of the blast
3406,i was shaking all over nervous scared excited
1282,i was so tired i was starting to make mistakes
2527,i was speechless as i stared up at it
3012,i was standing backstage watching as my brothers exited
1442,i was staring in awe at my surroundings
3462,i was taking quite the chance living in this house
265,i was way out of my league
1048,i wasn't speaking to him right then
1094,i went and answered it
1822,i went to the canvas and pulled off the sheet
3317,i will await you nearby
366,i will never stop dreaming of him
896,i will personally make sure it doesn't happen
4259,i winced as glass trickled to the ground
2183,i winced but held my tongue
1071,i won't distress you any further
3143,i won't ever force you into subservience
1155,i won't let him hurt you again
3190,i won't lie to you just to get you to forgive me
4033,i wondered how he handled apologies
3604,i work with these men every day
2943,i would occasionally go see local bands and quickly became friends with some of them
3132,i would say it matters more than anything
2740,i wouldn't be seeing her pain anymore only her ashes
2418,i wounded this rabbit and when we stopped it ran under the truck
3088,i write a quick note and insert it inside the package
825,i'd been thinking about those legs wrapped around me for three months too long
1800,i'd never realized he was aware of these moments or what they could mean
1327,i'll just carry our key
342,i'll send you the entire itinerary
3686,i'm a friend of the pack
3808,i'm afraid it would be wiser to take him with you
414,i'm already hating her for this
2202,i'm always amazed at how seriously men take themselves
1899,i'm getting to where i'm almost used to leaping out of an airplane
1435,i'm happy with what i see in the mirror
1844,i'm just trying to figure you out
2410,i'm not going anywhere with you
4203,i'm not sure i agree with you
3989,i'm not your sugar so i prefer you don't use that term on me
2398,i'm pretty certain i'll be the only one in there
1768,i'm pretty sure we can find carrot cookies for you
3607,i'm really not sure what happened back there
493,i'm suddenly surrounded by the scent of his cologne and i breathe it in
3319,i'm sure she told you about this program buddy
4229,i'm telling you all of this because i don't want any secrets between us
1221,i'm unsure why he's so confident
2626,i've already dug up all there is to find
771,i've been a part of his experiments and believe me he doesn't revere life
829,i've broken enough bones to know
684,i've ignored a few of his texts this week or just barely responded
4233,i've never been so happy in my entire life
3208,i've never met anyone who would do anything for his friends with no questions asked like you do
3867,i've spent every day so careful not to catch someone's eye or accidentally jostle them in the hall
1819,i've watched women being hurt in sex shows and haven't lifted a finger to help
4264,icy white because the blood had drained
3920,id been lucky with the first vampire
2814,if buzz wins they probably get away with it
1836,if either one of them caught sight of a blasted peacock it would take forever to catch them
3865,if everything went to plan it would be easy as falling off a log
3508,if he died she would die
3181,if he thought that was a possibility he wouldn't take her
1493,if he walks through that gate the curse will never end
310,if he's a real man he'll step up and be the rock you need right now
514,if his uncle thought it worth having they could always climb back up and fetch it later
586,if i can catch it again i might be able to find him
4471,if i could just look into him i would know
663,if i died here it wouldn't be for nothing
286,if it keeps up you're going to pass out or worse
1998,if none of them had come to wayward i would be happily living my life
3972,if nothing has happened by then you're in
1683,if she truly believed that she'd been abused she would tell him so now
260,if so his own was flagging
2609,if that had been death he didn't want to be alive again
1955,if thats how she gets her kicks fine
3647,if they were successful the students would spend their whole careers exposed to commercialism and sponsors
1023,if we whittle away at them when they've started to feel safe it'll erode their confidence
1355,if we wished to fight i know my chances won't be fair
3836,if you boys have studied anything about the western continent you would know that they practice slavery
386,if you fight me she dies along with the rest of you
429,if you find it grab it
3291,if you would like to share this book with another person please purchase an additional copy for each recipient
623,ignore it and it will go away
2755,impossibly large the creature had come ashore
3612,in all the years they'd been apart he'd never forgotten the way she made him feel
418,in bed in the shower moving into the kitchen for food then making love against the counter
2815,in fact i'd almost decided to call you one way or another
3278,in fact nothing had ever felt so right
696,in his experience of well over two thousand years he'd made that particular philosophy his own
156,in one quick movement he eased them off too
1012,in other words time is tight and i can not change the itinerary
616,in seconds the cruise ship was swamped under it caught like a dolphin in a tuna net
784,in that moment he prayed his friend only wanted to blow off steam too
3378,in the hallway he was exposed a sitting target out in the open
2330,in the meantime i was waiting by the baggage carousel watching and waiting
2859,in the outer room the voices fall and do not rise again
201,in time they would tell her the truth
1553,instantly the tension loosened replaced by regret for how he had reacted
3974,instead he began making plans to leave maybe establish another pirate republic elsewhere
2561,irritability had seeped into her personality until it and sadness defined her
3555,is there ever a point when your kids cant break your heart anymore
884,isn't it always like that
590,isn't that kind of funny
3327,it became very obvious very quickly that something was very wrong indeed
4385,it can't be she thought
360,it can't possibly be worth the eighty grand quoted to junction realty
2215,it contained a clear liquid
1803,it could prove usefulonce she freed herself
1211,it couldn't have been that hard to make a single phone call
1702,it did not seem like a promising way to begin thinking my way clear
129,it didn't sound like it even came from me but that wasn't really surprising anymore
1081,it doesn't have to be effective
3034,it felt less fast and more in my control knowing my house was still there
4172,it flew up and flipped over him reaching down grabbing a handful of his hair
3237,it gave him ample time to frame his response
952,it goes against the entire principle of what this pristine beauty was designed for
2968,it had been done up very nicely
1528,it had been too long
2232,it has to be animals or something
2070,it is a belief a decision an ethic
1634,it is my turn to roll my eyes
1058,it is soon sooner than i would have preferred but a baby is never a bad thing
387,it is still too dangerous to be seen associating with these christians
2650,it is who we are
932,it juts out over the ocean for a couple of miles
720,it looked like the good detective might pass out at any moment
3599,it made him want to run jump yell
2486,it must be nice being the boss
587,it must be wonderful to always know what was right to do
1973,it rang three times and stopped but then started right up again
3850,it seemed to do the same for her because holy hell we were crazed for each other
3797,it shines bright as day
1874,it should be easy enough
1716,it sounded like she lived the past year thinking i was destined for hell but said nothing to me
993,it sounds like iffy business
1410,it strikes me that belief is impossible without hope
750,it took him fifteen minutes to reach the ground floor
2425,it took me a while to get back on my feet and when i did it was chaos
244,it was a fair question
3603,it was a series of soft thumps as if something struck the compounds outer wall repeatedly
2758,it was a sleek ship and the water around it churned
3589,it was agreed as the waiter asked if they were ready
3478,it was all he had
1840,it was all too much to take in
250,it was an exhausted sound
3094,it was because i was kissing heather
2568,it was better than sitting around inside he supposed as he joined her to redon his boots
2830,it was bleakly depressing to think that they were us
1235,it was clearly just used for storage and even more clearly hadnt been opened up for weeks
2526,it was easier to open from the inside where you could rattle the handle a certain way
2490,it was going to take time for her to become comfortable with the mushy stuff
3249,it was good in the beginning
1679,it was just a silly test
1015,it was like he was flexing an arm he didn't have
437,it was like seeing blood drain from an artery
4105,it was like walking into a solid gold bar
2208,it was nearly impossible to tell his age
2136,it was only then that she realized how vigilant everyone was
17,it was scary as hell
3715,it was somber and kind
4070,it was still ten minutes until five
1611,it was the last thing i wanted to talk about
4294,it was the only thing he could see as he darted for the door
147,it was the only time our numbers were cut so great inside the city
1804,it was the size of a chicken egg only broken in half
4211,it was the wedding gift she wanted above all that was plain to see
217,it was then that it happened
3219,it was too painful to think about
4353,it was warm and soft
4188,it wasn't much but it was well kept
3648,it will be especially relevant to test run it during the hours of darkness
184,it will rip my heart out to see him dead but i want to see him
1067,it will his friend assured him
3785,it won't hurt anything
4278,it would be another fifteen minutes until the charges were set
3538,it would not do for us to betray those efforts with neglect
388,it's as loud as being in a club but i'm outdoors so it's easier to breathe through it
3079,it's just that i was rather surprised to see him again in here the other night
2328,it's powerful this kind of hold i have on him
1166,it's the sort of idea he gets
3843,it's the worst possible place for a first date
377,it's almost starting to fade out of my memory
4416,it's always better to attend a large funeral so that people don't get too nosy about why you're there
2770,it's been quiet for a while now
3315,its searchlight speared straight at the cabin blinding them
4008,its walls were solid stone so thick that he could hear nothing of the outside world
866,its weight felt light and nonthreatening
938,just remember lean on me when you need to
837,just that like all other fathers he wanted his baby bird to fly the nest
4442,just the distant lights of the city
2555,just then he was total determination
2791,just then the music changed to an oldie but goodie
62,just then our efforts to widen the crevice shifted the stones around him
2726,just try and thank you it is taste like a fish or something and finish
768,karou's glance flickered to where the corpse had been which did not go unnoticed by liraz
4494,knowing not to question him further she remained silent as excitement and anticipation took hold
345,last year we had the infamous halloween noreaster which blanketed us with nearly a foot
3497,leeza begged me as i walked into the kitchen yawning on saturday morning
2570,let him go i said to them
4301,let it hit him all at once
2834,let me start from the beginning
2358,letting it go as he always did
2878,life had suddenly become extremely complicated
196,like his former blinding need it was unexpected and sharp as a newly forged blade
507,like i said there was no way he could have told me when we first met
3979,listen i swear that i have nothing to do with any of this
2205,look how long it is
3389,looking at him now she wondered why on earth she couldn't draw him
4364,looking so still and absolutely dead
2347,love is all you need
131,lts were much less effective for soaring or long flights
3593,luckily the gunfire stopped as abruptly as it began
4440,makes sense he tried to smile at me but when i scowled back a burst of laughter escaped him
2233,many have met a bitter end here at the hands of a human warrior
2065,many of the walls were quite brilliant with bright contrasting colors
1795,many otherwise great warriors have met their end for being of this unfortunate opinion
613,maybe he needed to try a different approach
2683,maybe she changed her mind
990,maybe she didn't want to be alone
397,maybe she lives there with him or maybe we could find his family
1880,maybe shell just take the hint and not tease me endlessly about it
3200,maybe they keelhaul them she said raising an eyebrow
4171,maybe they weren't friends
1120,maybe you've just come to join me
3290,meanwhile the rest of us will be doing our jobs
3438,memories of those idyllic days made sheridan's eyes ache as she knelt at the stream
2059,might as well tell me all your innermost secrets and get it over with
2155,might be true she amended
2439,mini communities established themselves around housing location or trade
983,mom wiped a stray tear from her eyes
915,monk asked as the boat churned steadily toward the towering rock
2015,months of investigations as to who was the source of the egg resulted in nothing but dead ends
3601,more alien than the striped face at his shoulder
1539,more pressingly i wondered if anyone who wore my size lived here
4499,more water swirled into the yard like a whirlpool making everything brackish and muddy brown
1830,mortal part gave a little start
2043,most folks had arrived judging by all the vehicles parked near the house
1036,most of them are half naked and bruised
137,most of them took the fliers but quite a few were crumpled into balls and thrown away
315,mr greene when ye have more than one opponent ye can not wait fer them to advance on ye
1642,mum likes me to look smart
188,mum must have left you something
1242,must be lack of sex messing with her head
2823,my best friend is dead
3167,my birth dad was some guy she met at a party and never saw again
318,my eyes came back to him
3772,my eyes widened and all at once everything fell into place
353,my face lights up as my heart gets all warm and fuzzy
3898,my fingers jerked and i took a second to make sure my voice was controlled
138,my foot stepped down softly on the carpet and i shifted my weight to make the next step
2612,my gaze passed over an odd shape on my desk and then swung back
991,my hand released her arms and went straight to her hot cunt
2879,my hand slipped onto his robe and caught the fringe
3049,my hands fell to my sides
581,my head reeled with the implications
4354,my head sank down into my hands
3057,my head snapped in her direction
2833,my head swam and my knees went soft
2069,my hearing is better my eyesight better
112,my heart drummed unevenly and i froze every part of my body ice looking after the young man
4083,my heart spasms at my words and the awkward silence that rises up to smother me
2529,my heart went stone cold and i could barely breathe
524,my hosts levitated some humans natives
709,my internal diagnostics would tell me if i wasn't fit
4466,my mouth dropped open in horror
2801,my own mundane face looked back at me
1881,my phone buzzed with a text message the minute i stepped into my dorm room
3881,my pride hurts a lot more than my knee
2724,my room smelled like vanilla lavender the perfect relaxation scent that my aromatherapist recommended
1749,my so called morning sickness went away it turns out it was just the flu after all
583,my teeth gnashed together so forcefully my jaw ached
2317,my vision blurred as the sea spray whipped against my face mixing with my tears
1866,my voice was resolute now
753,my words come out more like i'm crying than angry
3596,nervous laughter makes vodka lemonade nearly shoot out my nose
577,never had an operation gyrated so out of control
2274,never play better than royalty does even if you're on the same team
4201,nevertheless i have lost my desire to sit in your presence any longer
1802,no doubt savanah and the two fledglings would get stronger in time he thought
1718,no matter what it's probably better for me to stay away from him as much as possible
4498,no one around him seemed to notice
3248,no one bullies me no one and that is exactly what he is trying to do again
4313,no one wore chains or prison uniforms
4228,no one would be lurking in the dense woods back here for fear of getting caught
213,no point in pretenses now
2285,no way to buy food to pay for stuff to do anything
422,no i think our parents have probably heard enough thanks
1518,no i'm a hundred years younger than her
1798,no i'm sorry i didn't know that
3313,no she could not even tell him she knew about this place
1486,no she thought a moment later
901,nobody does it better than you
3709,none at all i'm afraid
3447,none of them noticed the amorphous things creeping onto the grounds until snatched over the mouth by shapeless hands
2034,normally he would take a shower at this time of day but it just seemed meaningless right now
4082,not about the contest but the paper
1512,not even why he'd broken in
1457,not hurting him for the hell of it was harder than i thought it would be
3332,not just part of it
3996,not that he was complaining
4177,not that he was having an affair with her
3357,not that i'd have accepted help then
2722,not that it mattered if he washed them
1939,not to mention i really had no choice of whether i would attend him in his study or not
3352,nothing out of the ordinary
4347,now get on with the spellcasting
2002,now i have no choice
2115,now that i thought of it no one had ever given me a gift before
4275,now that the hair emergency is over i'm back to being freaked out
1757,now that we're bound we're interconnected so tightly that if i die you die
1032,now they would exact their revenge
3711,now we had a problem
438,now you know why i used to charge for it
3036,now hearing this story it made so much more sense
4029,now his cheeks were warm and he held my hands against them nuzzling them lovingly
1850,now however the seductive promise was more than a little tarnished
811,now its unfortunate but those who cant fight can not be our top priority right now
1663,now she didn't remember me
1054,now tell method to open the skylight and bring your son to me
2551,obviously the latter was the most sensible option
3362,of course we have no idea how asag's venom might affect them since they're born to another pantheon
3212,of much greater importance is the fact that the gashes had been carefully taped shut
1341,oh yeah this was bad
359,oh don't be so gullible
2068,okay a lot later than normal
2710,okay he didn't say that exactly
3542,once i get to the center i put my ballet slippers on
1338,one day he might let me go but not in that moment
3075,one has to communicate visually
2525,one man touched the casket
3232,one of the men pointed at the pup and began to chant in latin
1765,one part of her mind stopped the ridiculous rampaging thoughts of the other
1797,one piece of hair uncurled from my ponytail and fell down between us
1932,one such painting of an elephant earned him a large golden sticker from his distracted teacher
2379,one i leave behind my family
2110,only the driver wasn't going so fast now
2121,or a long night of slow passionate uninhibited lovemaking
1652,or at least the place that would be mine for another few hours
1591,or had he inadvertently given her back her life
4130,or perhaps that was just my paranoia showing through again
547,or that we'd get married one day
690,or why we want the things we want
2406,otherwise he seems much the same
1324,otherwise you'll fight me every step of the way and nothing would get accomplished
1065,our main concern was trina and our own injured
667,out of the entire forest the entire mountain the entire gorem region they always find us
3541,outside the court's gates my people wanted to imprison me
1503,outside jessie kissed me passionately
1306,over time the lumpen becomes a steady resident
241,pain shot through the ring at the same moment the guards untied his hands
1759,panic punched her in the stomach right in the solar plexus
3078,part of me wanted to cringe away from his penetrating gaze
648,patches of his thick black fur were plastered down to his body wet with blood
3616,patience son this will all fall into place and many other aspects as well when we journey back
79,people had so much fun between the deejay the pool game room and karaoke setup
3069,perhaps cavernous vacant rooms with dust lingering in the air and white sheets cloaking antique scratchy armchairs
844,perhaps she'd think he passed out
3155,pierce was still standing his jaw clenched and a dangerous look in his eyes
1285,placing it just the way he had found it he left
3356,please contact the editor at the above email address for further details
3665,pressure moved slowly across my forehead
4123,presumably his hands no longer rubbing either themselves or his face controlled that
3263,probably because lots of people have screwed me over
3474,proud he listened as still the chief spoke
1960,putting them in their graves had been the hardest thing he'd ever done
676,quite clearly that was what the woman was doing
3116,reach in and just rip it out of me because i cant take it anymore
4041,recently it had been recommissioned as a transport ship with a crew of three hundred
2613,recruit after recruit failed to perform as expected
849,right now we need your family intact
1594,rocked back and brought his feet together and took the same pace forward
4398,satisfied no one was in this canyon he widened the hole and peered out
1335,scorches on the floor and smoke damage on the ceiling
1249,sean sits me down on a little bench in front of a mirror
1833,seconds later i was tossed right back into my cage
2397,see what her terms are
1485,seeing horses exit from the delivery doors was enough to cause both hands to contract
1473,several luxurious chandeliers hang down adding to the grand theme and welcoming atmosphere
2428,several photos were on top
664,she accepted that she was hurt by his lack of communication
2596,she almost ran to him
4224,she already wore her civet cat bustier and the ladybug pendant
3970,she arrived the day before the conclusion of the fortnight
1426,she asked after another minute of silent contemplation
1302,she asked again looking pointedly at the door
3203,she asked her emotions swirling inside her almost making her dizzy
1903,she ate daintily and never looked up or made eye contact with any of the others
323,she bit her lip and nodded
1961,she blinked at me sleepily
4376,she braced her hands against his which were joined at her stomach
1364,she briefly felt the forearm
2148,she brings her hands up over her forehead in frustration
1189,she burns in my head
867,she carefully helped him step out of his clothes
2359,she claims that my uncle physically assaulted and abused her
1227,she claims to be an ass girl but she sure has a thing for my stomach
751,she clucked and shook her head
2484,she collects the remote from the armrest and aims it at the television muting it
530,she could have eaten another easily maybe two
1892,she could see the veins snaking under his skin like the growth of some delicate branching coral
4492,she could survive this too
3992,she couldn't be pissed
785,she couldn't believe he would move so quickly
1279,she couldn't believe what he had just said
1766,she cried out with the pleasure of it quaking inside splintering into a million shimmering pieces
2768,she crossed her arms over her chest and glowered
2745,she didn't belong among this glittering cast
2062,she didn't need my help
1581,she didn't seem to be aware of what was going on
2852,she didn't wait for him to answer
840,she didn't want to answer his question
435,she didn't want to think about that right now
1546,she doesn't shut up about that boy band
2909,she even tried to slip her own money into the letter when i wasn't looking
1403,she exclaimed grinning with an appreciative nod
2948,she fainted again disappearing behind the desk
1625,she fell against my shoulder sobbing uncontrollably
2986,she fell so madly in love with him she stopped thinking of it as sex
1316,she felt a warmth right there
3978,she felt almost too weak to remain standing on her own power
2006,she felt his leg his ankle
2541,she gazed up into his eyes
2603,she giggles making her hair shake just a little
409,she glanced around at the empty cabin and lifted her hands
462,she glanced back over her shoulder
3020,she glanced nervously toward the roof
2436,she grabbed his flashlight and returned with the food to the porch
1920,she grinned checking him out
786,she ground out the pronoun
3860,she had been thirty four but her body was that of a much younger woman
2824,she had her nose in the pantry when i walked in
3673,she had let him suck on her nipples had let him bury two fingers deep inside of her
456,she had to be kidding
2120,she hadnt come down off it yesterday
1572,she handed me the wand that was hooked to my bed
2925,she handed one to me on a plate and i gave it a doubtful look
4155,she hitches her purse up and over her round shoulder
1089,she holds her hands up and steps back a little
1020,she hurried forward and grabbed his arms
2881,she inhaled the scent of him
735,she isn't crazy but it's like she doesn't want to believe he's gone
2957,she jerked her thumb to the right
2500,she just reminded herself that millions upon millions of women and females had done this all before her
4063,she just stood there like a mannequin
219,she kissed him goodbye before work and by noon had him brought up on sexual harassment charges
741,she knew he needed her
148,she knew it wouldn't last
50,she laughed at my honesty
2756,she laughed when she looked down at the camera after taking the picture
1198,she leaned back against the seat as desire bloomed between her legs specific real sexual
1314,she leaned over to stare up into his eyes a smile curving her soft mouth
4159,she led him to the right
267,she lifted her brows gave a nod and waited
4336,she lifted her chin a notch and strode past him heading for the car
2474,she looked at me as if she wasn't sure why i was thanking her and i raised the coffee
3609,she looked at the clock on her nightstand and saw that it was not yet six in the morning
4064,she looked to dad then back at me and nodded
63,she looked up at me and smiled
1882,she lowered her eyes before he could read what she was feeling
3644,she lowered her whisper even further
3265,she made a momentary sweep around her body with her hands
1260,she made sure to jank him continually for all his misconceptions which seemed to ease his guilt
3120,she moved away from me and looked down
3316,she moved into the shadows to tuck herself away
3893,she needed him to know what to do because she sure didn't
3370,she never acts happy anyhow
352,she never opens her eyes
1255,she nibbled on her lower lip
3500,she nodded sweat dripping from the tip of her nose
465,she opened the limo door
4085,she patted me on the back
3349,she peered up at me handling me
3834,she picked out some clothes led me out of the closet then flipped the light off
3817,she planted her feet determined to slow the man down until he could come to his senses
2499,she pressed a button and scrutinized an image
481,she presses her lips together in a perfect straight line then narrows her eyes
2975,she pretended to be absorbed in the menu
4234,she pulled the sweater on over her head
1657,she pushed her hands in her pockets
948,she raised her hand and her fingertips traced over his lips
1491,she ran out of the kitchen and towards her room where she collapsed on her bed
2213,she reached down and ran a finger over his cheek
597,she reached for her pearls to calm herself but they weren't there
3502,she reached out and placed a hand on the arm of the other woman shaking her head
3011,she really should be more grateful to him she knew
2871,she reared back fingers hooked into claws to attack whoever had done it
4460,she refused to give him the satisfaction
2779,she removed her shirt and went into the bathroom to dry off with a towel
2130,she retrieved her phial of glowing water and dragged him into forbidden territory
2604,she rose from the bed and walked around the small room
2319,she rushed up to me and took me by both hands
3404,she said hoping he didn't detect the catch in her voice
455,she sang the whole song her voice carrying out over the water and coming back to her in harmony
874,she saw the redness in his eyes
2300,she says looking up to meet my eyes and i note the apprehension
3728,she says she cant stop doing it
695,she says she won't shoot me
1143,she shivered at his words
3702,she shook her head slowly
3003,she should have chosen another time and place but she had to know
3991,she showed up this morning without warning
2216,she sighed and looked away
2401,she sighed softly pacing slowly amongst the trees as she tried to work things out
1548,she slumped over too tired to maneuver such an unwieldy heavy load with her spirit so tattered
817,she smiled a simple smile one of sincerity and trust
4090,she smiled and gave me an approving wink
1051,she smiled wryly as she handed him the handkerchief
520,she sounded fierce and i was not the only one that saw her that way
2546,she sounded more calm than she looked
2970,she squatted down to and licked up one of my legs
3215,she stayed that way pressed against him until the doors opened on the first floor
3266,she stepped forward and cleared her throat
537,she stepped on his foot
699,she struggled fruitlessly for a while and then surrendered
3082,she struggles against my hold
3719,she strutted toward him her heels clicking off the ancient marble floor
1069,she stuttered for a moment then spoke
3191,she subconsciously scratched behind his ear and he looked as though he may contentedly drift off
1847,she surrounded him with her arms and fell into a doze
3778,she swallowed thickly as she saw declan motioning to her
1724,she then slid a sword to each hip before finally relaxing
824,she then slid her key card and disappeared behind the door
2597,she thought of that night
3637,she thought she heard another noise but couldnt tell where it came from
3634,she throws open the door and gasps
1005,she tipped her head back with a gasping moan
3473,she took a small sip of the flask then handed it back to me nodding at it
2679,she tried not to think about it
2198,she tried to regulate her breathing and bit her lip to keep the angry thoughts to herself
4028,she turned her head to one side to look up at him
678,she wanted to know but didn't want to remind him of how short his life would be
4457,she was a prize far more worthy of his interest
1052,she was already hungry and it wouldn't be ready for a couple of hours
224,she was covering a shift for a few hours
2127,she was one of you however
2423,she was right and he knew it
2134,she was skilled but all her attacks were straightforward
1823,she was so delicate that he always had to be very careful
2619,she was such a bad liar and she wanted away from whoever the hell her name was
749,she was sure of it
3364,she was the cutest thing i'd ever seen
1583,she was trembling uncontrollably now
868,she was wearing a white dress with pleats and silk ribbon trim
3721,she wasn't very experienced but knew enough to tell a dead man when she saw one
1453,she went to her locker and found some pills she had hidden in a pencil box
2593,she whipped the stick up ready to split his stupid skull
1956,she wished she'd paid more attention in the church first aid class
672,she woefully held a pool cue in her hand staring at her feet
1303,she wondered if her dad had warned them or something
3041,she wore a headscarf and a green gardeners coat
1183,she would just come up to the big house during the day
3809,she would know what to do about this whole mess
369,she wouldn't be surprised
1917,she wraps her arm around me and i rest my head on her shoulder
170,she'd been so very lonely today
2869,she'd hate to lose a team member before they had reached uncharted territory
1383,she'd never seen anything like it
1313,she'd seen her sister engage men in the most exquisite torture impressed and jealous at once
2101,she'd smiled as she gave it to me
3229,she's a difficult person to communicate with
2263,she's having a family dinner this friday night and she's dying to meet you
2875,she's one of those whose light bulb comes on at the most unusual time
2657,she's walking in the direction of the shop now
3823,shed made sure that her latest car contained the undercarriage connects
3554,shoulders were being worn bare this season
2335,sighing he rubbed his forehead leaving a smear of black ash
2117,sighing i go into the living room that has deep red walls and a brick fireplace
2739,similar to that sprouting tree i just showed you
1175,since he was feeling easier and the food was there in front of him he ate some more
2073,slowly i walked back to get my car from the parking lot
1272,smiling i thought about all the times we danced together growing up
385,snatched from his family and apprenticed to that awful man
3595,so as the soldiers march in and out for their shifts they bring along wagons
4161,so cold it was almost hot
425,so he was either unconscious sitting quietly or it was a trap
1696,so i guess ill need to teach you the difference between weeds and flowers
1446,so i play into it
192,so maybe he hadn't been planning to bail on me after all
1121,so she paraphrased an ancient historical vid instead
2271,so what that he'd done the same thing to her this morning
3511,so what was going to take nearly four days will now take less than one
2063,so whether or not we're dating i'm declaring us exclusive
876,so why wasn't she going
1283,so yes my loyalty does lie elsewhere inspector
3454,so you're back for good
1104,so if he would not come to her she would go to him
1638,so why did you call me here
1212,soaking wet pillows were the only ones available
959,some dying woman on the floor had fleshed her dagger with her last effort
469,some kid tried robbing me
1522,some movement across the room caught my eye and had me straightening in defense
4316,some of them were very bad people
3465,some wedding planner you are
4253,somehow the fact that the beer pyramid partially obscured him from view made the situation more bearable
21,someone had posted it and i hadn't been on my page in days so i hadn't noticed
421,someone with smoke curling out of their eye sockets takes some ignoring but everyone managed it
889,something happened to her something terrible
2177,something moved up ahead and it became a dead man walking only five feet away and out of nowhere
4303,something stirred inside her and she looked down by moving her eyes instead of her head
3394,something that i'd seen or heard or read or thought about in the last few days
3680,something you like to learn to do or to have
4476,somewhere above someone sobbed and wailed
3662,somewhere through all of this my daughter had seriously grown up
1843,sorry i can not offer what you are searching for
1097,sorry to be so blunt
3421,spare no expense to please and impress her
3198,spent most of my childhood at the opera
4496,spider waved the hook hand at her
4240,spinning lasers again dissolved sandstone to dust eroding away layers
1061,squeezing her eyes shut she takes one more breath she blocks out all the soundno distractions
2224,steel wouldve smiled at her determination if it had been under any other circumstances
4366,still in the first jar
3194,still the resemblance was uncanny
2951,stop that i said panting slightly
1686,straightening her spine she opened her eyes
1382,strong and warm it cups my own carefully like he is holding something very fragile
2374,suddenly the minutes seem to be tumbling forward
230,suddenly a thought occurred to him
2367,sunny flushed even hotter and glared at him
1868,sure enough about a dozen vamps were marching in my direction all of them clutching guns
3355,sure beats being inside on a day like this
2184,surely he couldn't know that the smitten kittens were sos or rather the real sos
1730,take your time ordering and maybe you'll be hungry again by then
1146,tall glimmering towers shrouded under rolling clouds and a rising sun whose rays cut through them like golden lances
42,tears blurred my vision but i sniffed and held them back
2498,tell me something even so small as cheating at a childs board game
2230,tension coiled so hard and fast inside him it was a wonder he slept at all
1607,thank you so much for your patronage
2422,that almost always translated into trouble
2094,that backstabber is going to pay for this
3028,that barely leashed violence that sense of ferocious energy held back was gone
477,that feeling of power was still all around him he realized and stronger than ever
3434,that had been the first time she'd used her power but not the last
1431,that had gone to shit
4391,that is a false statement
317,that is all i can ask of you uncle
205,that is where the art of possession comes in
857,that puzzled me as i felt sure he had someone in mind and i told him this
2789,that reminds me i have no clue where my father is or if he's coming home tonight
1489,that took some of the fire out of his eyes
2544,that was at least three miles in the dark
2658,that was when the real horror began
82,that would also fall under directive four interpreted as neglect
1375,that's why i couldn't tell you on the telephone
813,the agent didn't even question the orders
4365,the ancestral's lips curved and his shoulders lowered slowly
1502,the answering in his head sounded slurred and demonic
2435,the attack just passed through him as if he were made of thin air
3685,the beam of a flashlight
3271,the beauty of it was overwhelming even as seen through the eyeholes of her mask
2278,the boiler suit hung down around him
3945,the bone snapped as he released him and the other man tumbled into a heap
160,the bones pushed together and she got hold of the spine then yanked free some of the vertebrae
2692,the boundary is less than an hour away
4413,the boy smiled wide at the attention
2940,the bridge would lift automatically by simple removal of the iron bars
916,the brief elation of the experience was quickly squelched by regret
1707,the buzzing pervaded everything loudly from all directions
1293,the camera moves and the balloons obscure his face
2632,the captain said to his first mate another successful trip
3386,the castle had stood for thousands of years fighting off the ill tempered weather that never ceased
2742,the ceiling was white to match the carpet
1808,the charge is for calculating to breach the peace
864,the chicken they served was probably for christmas
1949,the closest feelings she could use to describe it was failure
1605,the coach calls for a break just as the cheerleaders run onto the green
4153,the cold golden mask was firmly in place
1305,the comment definitely didn't make me feel bad that was for sure
1436,the confidentially agreement will keep this under wraps don't worry
1216,the corps is a unit of many not one but dozens thousands even who have your back
599,the dark thing hovered between us now turning my blood to ice as i finally figured it out
1733,the daughter of his soul and the son of his blood had married yesterday
1241,the dean didn't beat around the bush
1087,the door opened soundlessly and the place was just as she'd left it
454,the drill sergeant smirked in response
800,the driver's side door squeaked as the man rolled down his window
3055,the edge was back in his voice
165,the elevator doors started to close
4079,the ensuring explosion took them all by surprise
562,the fact that he rarely spoke to his subordinates seemed to support my ideas about him
100,the fingers of his right hand swirled slightly and the entire row of candles leaped to life
1538,the friction was so sweet but it made her desperate for something she wasn't sure of
4315,the gangs didn't want to see the addicts leave
398,the gesture is sweet and unexpected
2321,the gravel lot in front of the building contained an assortment of vehicles and patrons
1897,the greyness grew lighter and in the distance puddles of water covered the damp earth
1579,the gun barrel trembled in the old man's hands
2384,the hatred he had fought so hard to bury had been summoned
1347,the heavy darkness closed in again like curtains and now he knew what the dwarfs meant
2539,the hedgerow encompassed the entire area with a single arched entryway off to one side
2840,the jury was disgusted with me and they did nothing to hide it
603,the kitchen faded from my eyes
151,the last thing i see is the monster watching me
2489,the little scientist appeared to decide that he ought to say no more
4209,the man grinned back but it didn't reach his eyes
2135,the man had emotions and it was past time he got in touch with them
4196,the man looked at him then propped himself on one elbow to scratch out words on the paper
2795,the man rested a hand on his sons red head
497,the man screwed his face up and put his finger to his lips
3354,the memory of her grief and her tears that bleak morning was fresh in her mind even now
3552,the men embraced and clapped each others backs briefly
436,the men gave a single united cry many of them knowing that they would soon all be dead
1236,the message repeated itself endlessly
403,the moment was etched in time transcending the constraints put on them by life
2025,the month and day i mean of course she added quickly
3161,the morrs had split themselves into three groups
3682,the most pertinent points are often those which would otherwise pass you by
1924,the next few seconds are frozen
4446,the next sound he heard was not one of love however
4220,the next sound we heard was a loud fart and a groan of relief
3691,the night before that they had come upon an old woman
2225,the night was still young and it was warm and gratefully the moon was full
1000,the one that was then killed by said study group
3369,the ones he picked tended to be simple and super masculine
2590,the only commonality was that they'd crossed my path
1353,the only happiness ill get waits for me after i'm dead
3455,the only person who can talk you out of or into that is yourself
3285,the other being that it meant she was braless and that drove me from mindless to madness incarnate
1150,the other came up behind her and shoved something hard and cold against the small of her back
2991,the other one was captured
4097,the pain price stopped as abruptly as it started
159,the paramedic on her right asked as he helped her sit up
299,the park was a little more peaceful
53,the patio sank six inches into the ground
4417,the people i cared about would come to visit me
1197,the person i was before was living in a state of blessed ignorance
3958,the perspiration broke out on his forehead and the mists of fear closed in again behind his eyes
4089,the pilot did not answer
3477,the pilot turned back to the front still shaking his head and laughing
691,the pleasure blurred with pain as unbearable as it was necessary
4479,the police captain may be on your payroll but his duties are not exclusive to your wishes
1870,the prepaid cell phone in his pocket vibrated with a message for the second time that day
2847,the questions multiply as i stand here on the sidewalk people moving about cabs honking their horns life
3981,the rebel tanks behind them immediately returned fire leveling several of the buildings along both sides of the town
2203,the rebelious warriors would sneak one by one into the cave
4452,the reflection that peered back at me now still didn't look good exactly but it certainly looked improved
30,the resistance against the twisting at first increased a lot then suddenly decreased
3425,the rest of the players did not share the humor
119,the rogue pointed the knife at her again accusing you are one of them
2763,the ruins of warehouses and the greenery remained behind
1184,the rush of heat had her whole body tensing her nerves jumping
1413,the secretary of state you idiot
1210,the sense of looking forward to your day
2188,the shouts were louder now and i looked again for the lady
2747,the smell hit me right away causing me to stop
3476,the smell of the ocean on her skin was intoxicating
3819,the society is aware of the secret room at the end of the hall of dread
3460,the square window in the door was clean but cracked
473,the stroke of a finger over hair
4227,the sun had departed already and the western sky was filled with a sullen furnace light
1064,the sun was setting but light still covered the house gardens and the rolling fields to the west
1038,the switch was already up which meant the overhead light should be on but it wasn't
2404,the taste of his words lingers on my lips
3921,the tears were flowing freely and there was no effort to hide them
400,the television was black the remote control sat perfectly straight on an end table
2778,the thought of him hiding something made her angry
3585,the tigress leapt up and spun around nearly taking me off my feet with her butt
3133,the toilet wasn't stained and the stooped shower wasn't filled with mold
924,the tone in his voice has changed considerably
258,the two most powerful men in the western world faced each other
3427,the understatement of his entire life
3176,the unmistakable sound of falling rock
3412,the veins in his nose stood out like worms
3007,the waiter looked disapproving as he served her drink
1709,the waitress narrowed her eyes already making up her ignorant mind about me
2577,the walls of the needle
1415,the warlord did not reply however he charged at his king grabbing his throat with a most powerful grasp
999,the weather sucked and she didn't want to waste money on a cab
3185,the wireless is just for idle talk and we can do without
1401,the woman was tormenting him
506,the wood disintegrated into dust
2310,their best chance to escape was to move quickly and efficiently
1290,then he cursed at his stupidity while he waited for her to let him have it
4271,then he leaned away from me his eyes glazed as they met mine
3666,then he sat down and started going through the book again this time from the beginning
2099,then he seized the spade and began to deepen the hole
240,then i grabbed his neck and hurled him over onto his back
4074,then i heard footsteps i knew and i opened my eyes
1271,then i reached in and tapped it off with a finger
2560,then she snapped her mouth shut
1132,then she tried to lure me inside with candy tea and promises of playing with her thousand cats
1315,then the questions began as discussions turned to next steps
3466,then very deliberately he mounted her
3268,there are plenty of delicious mosquitoes flies and other insects to go around
619,there had to be a strategy that would work
3966,there is a demon inside her a thing named amel
1019,there is a fine line sometimes between justice and brutality
4186,there is so much left to do
1004,there was a flicker in the glass
149,there was a knock at the door
3839,there was a lengthy exchange of yaps
2711,there was a long silence in the small cottage after verity's noisy departure
2252,there was a pause in her part of our dialogue but it was barely perceptible
179,there was a pause an uncomfortable one
2793,there was a smudge of dirt across her left cheek
2087,there was a window with white fabric blinds closed against the night
2518,there was definitely a crossbow being wielded by a dim figure
634,there was no enthusiasm in his voice just a dull flatness that didn't sound like him at all
3309,there was no real need for extended farewells among these four because they would never really be apart
3300,there was no trace of anyone having worked here for so long
424,there was no way my mother would have lied about something so serious
526,there was nobody i dared confide in
2149,there was nothing there but that huge window and sloping ceiling above it
3172,there was only the law written in blood that the criminals exiled beyond the portal gave themselves
225,there was only the light of the altar pressing against the shadows
2355,there was silence at that suggestion
1361,there was something about him i didn't trust
3164,there was the ghost of a laugh in the voice that answered her
3813,there were also frequent rest breaks outside
2586,there were her footprints in the sand but they went only a few feet and anyway were slowly disappearing
2485,there were less serious cuts on his neck and chest but those could wait
28,there were muddy streaks on his cheekbones
2338,these doors held endless possibilities and none of them were good
470,these have been our days
1404,these pineapples are shipped everywhere
419,they all hardened as though they had been iced up and then sniffed and snuffed without an ending
2473,they appeared to be top military brass from every branch of service
2623,they are white and pale blue and dull green and they draw me to them by some strange magnetism
1996,they aren't in a cemetery
1439,they came in through the front door tearing up everything they could
3031,they could but it wouldn't last
1348,they could see her mouth some words as there was no audio
3255,they either use a birth date of a family member or some other significant date
1386,they hadn't bothered to look very carefully
3572,they have declared the war against other people who were living inside
1182,they have the most to lose
532,they heard a brief shuffling from the other side a few muttered whispers then a hatch opened up
4349,they looked nervous both of them
3030,they might even call us norante
655,they milk you for blood
2243,they moved fast enough that they'd be in italy in a matter of minutes
26,they reached the moving stairs
3487,they stood just past their archers and watched as the four men ran into a rainstorm of arrows
3624,they threw themselves against the boulder but could not budge it
2587,they try to imitate the brushstrokes of the great masters but they fall short
2180,they were ugly to the human eyes
1264,they weren't serious were they
568,they will be given means to travel
2997,they will be going on for a long time yet
799,they will never know she has changed
124,they won't want the grubby heavy coins not when they see this
1995,they would capture or destroy the forerunner
4379,they would have much preferred to make him suffer a long slow painful death
143,they're going to be amazing people i know this
3582,they're sleeping through the night completely now
489,thickly lashed wide black eyes stared back at me
1049,things that made me withdraw from people and disconnect from life
2003,think of how good it feels to be clean
3751,think we can find that person who saw them together
670,this cold finite arrangement she'd made was still more than he'd dreamed he would have
937,this guy is not my type at all
835,this healing process is going to take some more days before i can use my extremities without pain
2982,this i can not allow
2558,this is crazy he said
3780,this is my last chance
2138,this made him good at defending himself
4436,this must have been more of what the whole planet looked like before the mortals took over
4458,this new bedroom provided the same whimsical variety
1428,this should be easy then
1934,this view always used to calm me
2839,this was one of those times
1379,this was so special so curious how he was built
10,this was the funniest damn thing i'd ever heard
3628,those lush full lips of his beckon me like some otherworldly aphrodisiac
4104,those men had it coming
3183,though still thirsty and hungry she felt rested
1396,though tears began to well inside his eyes he forced them to go harder firmer determined to show nothing
2471,three years had flown by so quickly
1848,time could bifurcate like a pair of trousers
1613,time for a subject change
4260,time moves quickly as i watch the department work and we reach imminent launch
736,to annoy him she took her time
407,to brush the strands back from his forehead
164,to see my tough husband such a mess was like losing him all together
975,to the city of glass and bone no less
914,today is the day she learns what it takes to stay on the light clan
3723,told him he had to stop
1447,true love was a myth a misdirection from the solid things in life
2223,truthfully she wouldn't have minded if he rested fully on her
1928,two of them were crying but the third glared at me as if to say this is your fault
997,two swords meant it was here to duel somebody
4495,unfortunately it wasn't quite enough resentment to make him stop thinking about her lack of underwear
3533,unless you count meeting her in my dreams
1495,until my body felt as though it would burst into flames
2782,until suddenly one day she saw him there
839,usually at this time of the morning warriors surrounded the table devouring every morsel of food
2594,very artsy and in touch with her feelings without being a flake
365,voices carried over from the doorway of the shop
3329,wait go back in the shed and grab those ropes we have for closing off areas
102,was he appalled that i was a meregal
483,was he really so arrogant and stubborn that he wouldn't listen to the people he cared about most
1685,was it possible he was sick
476,was searching he confessed seeming suitably chastened
855,was the joust all you had hoped for
2543,was there a foundation for the tenuous instinctive fears that i couldn't seem to shake
4199,waves i don't normally bother to make happen since my hair is boringly straight
2235,we all want to retain whatever personality we have
2549,we always try to find methods of controlling pests without the use of harmful chemicals
3507,we burst into flames that burned brighter than the sun
150,we can share mine if you don't hog too much of it
2897,we can't both have gotten on the wrong plane
3896,we didn't do anything to them
69,we didn't have any reaction except to try and get to safety
1760,we found out that he had been staying with an old woman seven doors down from us
4314,we have all of our gear and ammunition for the stovepipe sir
167,we kissed for what felt like forever
1204,we land with a thud
287,we need to notify a v designs
2189,we save the whole date thing for prom
4324,we slipped back down the emergency stairs without incident
3907,we stop when they're side by side
3549,we strained and moved together and when he entered me i screamed with the force of my climax
2058,we tell each other everything
2209,we took as much as we could carry in the trucks to top off what we had
3906,we took turns examining each others wounds to make sure there wasn't anything which needed immediate attention
1079,we were both quiet for a few seconds
268,we will be there within a day
2930,we will do whatever it takes to work things out whatever it takes
3429,we would have shrugged and moved on to the next thing
4092,we'll know soon if he can play football next week
2675,we're family he wanted you to carry on the tradition and keep this place a home
508,we've got two more down here and are going around to the back
58,weird and unusual things happen all the time
1564,well look what you did
1942,well the people who didn't escape might have caused an uprising
2765,well it's sort of true
54,weve never been sick from eating them unwashed yet
2381,what about our competitive sand race
1792,what are you getting at
1597,what do you think they should do with murderers
1129,what else can my answer be except an expression of prejudice
565,what happened in the days immediately following this
4404,what helps the true healing begin
1325,what if you make a mistake and tell them i did it
1217,what kind of sword do you have
4002,what makes a good story
958,what she'll never know is she's the glue that holds it together
3035,what she's really wondering is whether he's changed
2863,what the hell was i doing
2119,what would you rather have
2386,whatever she suggested he would try
2170,whatever the next adventure might be at least i wouldn't be facing it alone
1911,when did you get onboard
3214,when do you want to have the wedding
140,when he began to scowl again she continued
1867,when he dismounted he had to catch himself on a tree limb to keep from falling
2898,when he finally came she was completely weak and sated
2360,when he hit the sidewalk he was running
1381,when he saw me he nearly dropped it
2796,when i came to this world i didn't have a religion like the very first man on earth
1777,when i did his eyes changed completely
490,when i didn't move away our one kiss intensified
1530,when i don't respond he puts a hand on my guitar
1799,when i turned i didn't see anything but his face changed became closed and tight
4381,when i was at your place said almeric a note of accusation in his voice
1721,when it cleared the divine will though burnt and melted at the edges was still whole
830,when it did a river of blood flowed from the wound dousing the mans chest stomach and groin
1756,when one of the rock chicks finds trouble every one of the hot boy brigade kicks in
1230,when she heard a car coming down the road behind her she moved off to the side
3537,when she rested her arm on her bare knee she felt the same tiny wounds on her wrist
3179,when she's in town yes
966,when the name of the city left his lips a dagger slid across his throat
471,when they got home she would choose ones for strength for courage for protection
3188,when we met he asked if we help men
2629,where are you taking me
4025,where did you get it
2281,where had i been and what had i done
1780,where he tried the doors on the new addition they were locked too
1714,which means it is too dangerous for them to travel with us
895,which one of you is responsible
118,which incidentally cost three hundred dollars a pair
2620,who could kill him especially like that
479,who is the best painter here if not you
2926,who knows what really would have happened
1748,who struck the first blow
2816,whoever you've been saying i love you to on the phone
4408,whole string of burros to carry it
1640,why bring the violence of the battlefield into the bedroom
556,why can't i move
1378,why do you feel the need to protect and take care of everyone
3217,why does that surprise you
313,why i came with them
3308,why punish me with such a place
3294,why was i talking at all
4250,why was she like this now
3600,why would you give it to me
2767,will you do that for us
1592,will you just let me finish
725,with a firm push he nudged her over on her back
3450,with a flicker of white it flashed on revealing the rough grooved surface of the old desk
2627,with expertise he unsnapped the bra tossing it off to the side as his fingers continued their exploration
2746,with his hands on her hips he slammed into her
103,with the water still running he began undressing right there in front of me
1234,within minutes she was writhing beneath his hands and mouth
1860,without hesitation i called her back
917,without my encryption code it would be next to impossible to find it
4247,without your knowledge and persistence we never would have built this home
2081,women always get their way with a man if they really want him
1192,worry marked many faces aging us past our years
1096,would they get their chance
2004,wouldn't you want a sip
3909,yes i think this is how it should be
4500,yes it sounds like him
2459,yes my friend of course i will teach you to fight
1863,yes she said her voice almost a whisper
327,yes she was one up on me
1153,yes she'd enjoyed their lovemaking as much as he had
3288,yes that would certainly change
3318,yes well i started that site mostly for the school kids
3516,you are a warrior monk not a hairdresser
1954,you are going to do many great things
2344,you are not like the other changelings or the humans i have known
3903,you are the only one who can get rid of her
2906,you aren't helping the bionics you're dooming them
821,you bring out the worst in me
3524,you can definitely go home now
1154,you can if you like
1188,you can stand me in front of the firing squad
1631,you can take your break now
2254,you can't be surprised
3964,you can't do this
2744,you claimed back your land revoking the privilege of the mist to operate there
3610,you could have fooled me i spit out
1727,you did a good job
2736,you don't just get over something like that all of a sudden
3982,you don't look so innocent
3855,you don't think i do believe he really felt something for you
4309,you don't think that i will win
3546,you even draw yourself inside it although it must be very cramped in there
3047,you go around like a zombie and that's what you are a kind of a zombie
2972,you had the oil lamps behind the seashells too bright
3796,you know how guys are
4319,you know to wait until i return the captain said angry with ricuss lack of protocol
14,you mean until i give in and do it your way she said bitterly
541,you only have us to hang with at the clubs
1179,you see those pieces on the floor
4152,you still are the innocent empress your father nurtured with so much care and affection
2323,you taught me not to be weak
1890,you think you work you die there's no after life no purgatory
475,you understand how he was
3363,you were right to stay
4489,you will never commit to a man
2639,you wish to go back to your dark and silent miserium
1152,you wonder whether they have them
3033,you'd think i'd be used to the taste by now but never mind
1077,you'll be hundreds of miles away
4390,you'll go on that full scholarship you're going to earn
3845,you'll see what i mean
29,you're a fine harvest empress
1394,you're al i think about anymore
1253,you're going to be in trouble anyway when the school calls your parents
3107,you're nothing like any of my other students he said
2687,you're the one always saying surrender is never an option
4204,your father had big plans for himself and his little coven of followers
2313,your nanny was gone for a long time or your older sister
